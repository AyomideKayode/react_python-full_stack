## Sending a POST Request with JSON Data

- To test the API's functionality for creating a new friend record, I utilized `Postman`, a popular API testing tool.
- Also available as a VSCode extension.

Here's the step-by-step process I followed:

- Set the URL: Entered the endpoint URL (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/friends`) in Postman's address bar.
- Choose the HTTP Method: Selected `POST` from the HTTP method dropdown.
- Set the Headers: Added a new header with `Key: Content-Type` and `Value: application/json` to ensure the server processes the request as JSON.
- Set the Body: Chose the `raw` option under the `Body` tab, selected `JSON` from the dropdown, and input the JSON data:

```json
{
    "name": "Ayomide Kayode", whatever you like
    "role": "Developer",
    "description": "A skilled full stack developerüòÅ",
    "gender": "male"
}
```

- Send the Request: Clicked the `Send` button to submit the request.

Upon correctly setting the headers and body, the server successfully processed the request, resulting in a success message confirming the creation of the new friend record. This step is crucial for ensuring that the server understands the format of the incoming data and can handle it appropriately.

## Sending a UPDATE Request with JSON Data

- Set the URL: Entered the endpoint URL (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/friends/<int:id>`) in Postman's address bar.
- Take note to add the `id` of the user to update in the endpoint URL.
- Choose the HTTP Method: Selected `PATCH` from the HTTP method dropdown.
- Set the Headers: Added a new header with `Key: Content-Type` and `Value: application/json` to ensure the server processes the request as JSON.
- Set the Body: Chose the `raw` option under the `Body` tab, selected `JSON` from the dropdown, and input the JSON data of the fields you would want to make changes to:

```json
{
  "name": "Ayomide Kayode",
    "role": "Product Designer",
    "description": "A UI/UX DesignerüòÅ"
}
```

- Send the Request: Clicked the `Send` button to submit the request.

## Sending a DELETE Request with JSON Data

- Set the URL: Entered the endpoint URL (`http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/friends/<int:id>`) in Postman's address bar.
- Take note to add the `id` of the user to delete in the endpoint URL.
- Choose the HTTP Method: Selected `DELETE` from the HTTP method dropdown.

- Send the Request: Clicked the `Send` button to submit the request.
